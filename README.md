# Sport tracker

Basic sport tracker to follow the progress on my fitness goals.

I looked at [wger](https://github.com/wger-project/wger) which was interesting
but didn't allow me to just input workouts when I do them, and instead forced
using a schedule, so I'm making my own thing.

## Features

The tracker is meant to help follow your progress on a low amount of exercises.

For example I want to track my progress on the powerlifting exercises, the
handstand and the handstand pushup.

- Provide a simple way to track progress for both weighted and body-weight
  exercises
  - When starting a workout, select a template
  - Enter the values as you do your workout
  - Validate at the end, it will be saved
- Show a calendar with the worked days (A colored dot for each exercise)
- Show a progress bar for each exercise

Considered features:
- For exercises with 1RM (rep max) that aren't practiced often, give an
  estimation of the 1RM weight from the amount of reps.
